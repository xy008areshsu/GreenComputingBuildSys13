Papers in the previous work look at things in isolation.  We combine them.  Inspired by Parasol, which does something similar for computing loads in a solar-powered data center.  Home loads are a little different; have different degrees of scheduling freedom, but may have more limitations.  We use a linear program below to do the scheduling.
