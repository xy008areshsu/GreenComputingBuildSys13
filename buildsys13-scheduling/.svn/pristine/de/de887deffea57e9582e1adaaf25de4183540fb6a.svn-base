We first introduce the different dimensions of scheduling freedom available to some electric loads, as well as highlight prior research that focuses on optimizing each particular degree of freedom in isolation, either to reduce consumer costs or the grid's peak usage. In addition, we discuss the limitations of each metric in exploiting variable rate pricing plans to lower a consumer's electric bill.  The primary degrees of freedom we identify are the ability to transparently shift, slide, stretch, store, or sell power.  Note that some loads may exhibit multiple degrees of scheduling freedom.

\noindent {\bf Shifting} power refers to scheduling on-off loads that operate over one or more duty cycles, such that within each duty cycle the load is on for some period of time and off for some period of time.  The length of the duty cycle and the amount of time a load is on within each cycle may be either static, e.g., if driven by a timer, or dynamic, e.g., if driven by a thermostat.  In either case, the load must be on for a fixed amount of time during a cycle to satisfy its objective, such as keeping the temperature of an enclosed space within a specified range or guardband.  However, as long as the scheduler ensures the load is on for this time each cycle, it is free to determine \emph{when} the load is on during the cycle without violating its objective.  This freedom is often referred to as \emph{slack}~\cite{smartcap,culler-smartgridcomm}.

Prior work focuses on scheduling these shiftable on-off loads either to i) align as much load as possible with renewables~\cite{culler-smartgridcomm}, ii) defer loads during times of grid constraint~\cite{nplug}, or iii) flatten a building's demand profile~\cite{smartcap,krithi-ac}.   However, prior work does not address the lack of monetary incentive for consumers to shift loads.  Since the duty cycle length for common shiftable loads, such as an air conditioner or refrigerator, are at most a couple of hours, and often much less, schedulers are only able to shift these loads within narrow time periods without violating their objectives.  As a result, shiftable loads cannot exploit the TOU/RTP pricing models from Figure~\ref{fig:pricing}, which require consumers to shift load to off-peak periods that may be many hours from the peak periods.

\noindent {\bf Sliding} power refers to deferring the start time of a batched load, such as a dishwasher, washing machine, or dryer, that performs a, usually non-preemptible, batch task for a fixed, well-known period of time~\cite{culler-smartgridcomm}.   These loads are first initialized by a user, and then run for a pre-determined amount of time without user intervention before being emptied and reset by the user.  In some cases, these loads are pipelined.  For example, clothes are usually washed and then dried in sequence.  In addition, some loads may also be preemptible, in which case, once started, they also act as shiftable loads that operate over a single duty cycle.   As long as an user has initialized a load, e.g., filled it with clothes or dishes, a scheduler has the freedom to indefinitely delay its start time.  Of course, delaying the start time also delays the end time, which may in-turn cause delays in the pipeline.  The primary constraint for transparently scheduling slide loads is the amount of inconvenience a user is willing to tolerate.  Since user's directly control when to initialize and start slide loads, incentivizing them to change when they operate these loads is an important goal of existing variable rate pricing plans.  Unfortunately, as above, users are often unwilling to delay start times many hours into the future, e.g., from daytime to nighttime, which severely limits scheduling freedom.

\noindent {\bf Stretching} power refers to extending an elastic load's running time, while lowering its average power usage to keep its energy consumption constant for a particular task~\cite{keshav-elastic}.   Typically, elastic loads utilize resistive heating elements or variable drive motors, which enable a scheduler to precisely adjust temperature or speed, respectively, as well as running time.  Examples of elastic loads cited in prior work include washing machines, dryers, dishwashers, ovens, stoves, refrigerators, freezers, air conditioners, electric water heaters, and electric space heaters.  Of course, schedulers cannot just arbitrarily stretch a load, since the average power usage and duration of a task affect its operation.  For example, running dryers at high heat for a short duration works well for heavy fabrics, while low heat for a long duration is better for delicate fabrics.  Thus,  prior work~\cite{keshav-elastic} places a relatively low upper limit ($\sim$10\%) on stretching a load's running time.

\noindent {\bf Storing} large amounts of power during high price periods and then using this stored power during low price periods is the most effective way to transparently schedule loads and lower a consumer's electricity bill under today's variable rate pricing plans.  Prior work explores many different aspects of scheduling energy storage, largely in the form of lead-acid batteries, to exploit this opportunity for arbitrage~\cite{keshav12,original,grid-storage,smartcharge,optimal-price,aamas10}.  Unfortunately, energy storage, especially at small scales, is expensive.  As prior work shows, either electricity prices must rise, or battery prices must fall, by an order of magnitude before energy storage's return-on-investment (ROI)  would near a break-even point~\cite{keshav12,smartcharge}.  One reason for the high ROI is that TOU/RTP pricing plans require consumers to install a large amount of storage capacity to shift as much load as possible from high-price daytime periods to low-price nighttime periods.

\noindent {\bf Selling} power, e.g., via net metering, is an option for homes that generate their own power using on-site renewables, such as solar power.  However, in many cases, the price utilities pay consumers for power is less than the price they charge them for it.  In addition, current laws often place strict caps on the amount of power a utility must buy back from a consumer.  These dynamics alter the scheduling problem by incentivizing consumers to, not only transfer load to low-price periods, but also to align as much of it as possible with renewable generation~\cite{greencharge,culler-smartgridcomm,buildsys11}.  Aligning a home's load with renewable generation also decreases grid transmission losses, since it increases the amount of power consumed at the point of generation. The scheduling limitations above affect the freedom to align load with renewable generation.  

%Interestingly, for solar power, the incentive to align as much load as possible with generation, which mostly occurs during the day, conflicts with the incentive to transfer as much load as possible to low-price periods.
