The prior research described in \Section\ref{sec:related} focuses on optimizing different dimensions of scheduling freedom in isolation.  In this paper, we compare the performance of optimizing each scheduling dimension in isolation with a combined approach that jointly optimizes scheduling for all types of loads, e.g., shiftable, stretchable, slidable, etc.  As in prior work, we formulate our combined scheduling problem as a mixed integer linear program (MILP).  In particular, we extend the MILP used by Parasol~\cite{parasol}, a solar-powered micro-data center, that schedules batch jobs with well-known running times and deadlines.   As with our MILP, Parasol's objective is to minimize electricity costs under TOU/RTP rate plans and maximize the use of solar power, albeit for a data center instead of a home.  However, while Parasol accounts for energy storage, net metering, and slide loads (which are akin to batch jobs), we extend our MILP to schedule shiftable and stretchable loads.  Of course, our work also differs from Parasol, since a home is substantially different than a data center in terms of its users, workloads, devices, and scheduling freedom.

\input{table}

We frame our MILP using the parameters in Table~\ref{table:parameters}.   We model both $\vec{L_{slide}[power]}$ and $\vec{L_{shift}[power]}$ as vectors of tuples that specify each load's start time, running time, and power usage.  We assume slide loads also have a completion deadline.  We then divide each day into $T$ discrete intervals of length $l$ from 1 to $T$ with the objective of minimizing $\sum_{i=0}^{T} (m_i*P^{i}_grid - \alpha*m_i*N^{i}_{green}$) each day, or the net bill after any net metering, given the following constraints.

%% Power discharged from the battery is never greater than the power charged to the battery

\label{c2}
\sum_{i=0}^{T} L_{battery} - e*\sum_{i=0}^{T} (B_{green}+B_{grid}) \le 0

%% Energy stored in the battery cannot be greater than its capacity
\begin{equation}

\label{c8}

=L_{i} - \vec{L^{i}_{slide}[power]} - \vec{L^{i}_{shift}[power]}
\end{split}
\vspace{-0.4cm}
\end{equation}

%% Shiftable loads: power must be the same each period
\begin{equation}
\label{c10}
\begin{split}
\forall \vec{L^{i}_{shift}}, \forall i \in \frac{T}{L^{i}_{shift}[period]}, \sum L^{i}_{shift}[power]\\

\end{equation}

Briefly, the constraints above ensure the following properties:  (1)  the battery's charging rate is not more than its capacity divided by 4; (2) \ the energy charged to the battery never exceeds the energy discharged from it; (3) the energy stored in the battery never exceeds its capacity; (4) net metering and battery charging do not occur at the same; (5) battery charging and discharging do not occur at the same time; (6) renewable generation can charge the battery; (7)  renewable generated can be net metered; (8) cannot consume grid power and net meter at the same time; (9) every load is powered by only one energy source; (10) the amount of power shiftable loads consume per period is constant; and (11) slide loads cannot run past their deadline.  

Constraints (4), (5), and (8) are non-linear mutual exclusion constraints. We convert these to linear constraints by introducing a binary variable $b \in \{0,1\}$ and replacing each non-linear mutual exclusion constraint with five linear constraints that enforce the same invariant.  In this case, we replace any constraint of the form $\forall i \in \{T | x>0\}, y = 0$ with $x-\inf*b \le 0$, $-\inf*x + b \le 0$, $y+\inf*b \le \inf$, $x \ge 0$, and $y \ge 0$.  Finally, ensuring slide loads complete within their deadline does also not map well to a linear constraint. Thus, for a given slide load each day, we simply run the MILP $T/i$ times for each possible start time of the slide load and then use minimum cost schedule.  Of course, as the number of slide loads increases, we must run the MILP for each possible combination of start times.  However, the approach is tractable, since the number of slide loads is typically small, e.g., usually three or less, and they often do not run everyday.

XXX Need to say something about stretchable loads

%%  The home has three slide loads (a dryer, a washing machine, and a dishwasher), four shfitable loads (a refrigerator and four 

We use our MILP above to quantify the cost savings from each dimension of scheduling freedom, both in isolation and in combination over a 60-day period for a representative home for both the TOU and RTP pricing plans depicted in Figure~\ref{fig:pricing}.  In our experiments, we run our MILP at the beginning of each day with $T=24$, assuming that we know home's power demand $p_i$, renewable generation $g_i$, and the electricity cost each interval.  In practice, our system requires predictions for these parameters~\cite{cloudy-computing,smartcharge}. Thus, our results represent an upper-bound on the cost savings due to scheduling.  

Figure~\ref{fig:isolation} shows the percentage cost savings from scheduling only shiftable loads (a), slidable loads (b), and stretchable loads (c) in isolation. In each case, the $x$-axis represents the degree of scheduling freedom for each load. The result demonstrates that as scheduling freedom increases, so do the savings.   Unfortunately, practical values for the $x$-axis in each case are generally low.  For example, as the length of the duty cycle for a shiftable load increases, the scheduler has more freedom to shift power usage long periods of time without violating the constraint that energy usage within a duty cycle must be constant.  In practice, common shiftable loads, such as refrigerators, freezers, heaters, and air conditioners, have duty cycles of only a few hours or less, which results in savings of less than 10\%.  Similarly, while slide loads reduce costs if slid multiple hours into the future to low cost periods, such long delays impose a significant burden on users.  Finally, stretching loads only provides significant savings for unrealistically large stretch factors, e.g., $>3x$, that are greater than the 10\% assumed in prior work~\cite{keshav-elastic}.

%We then denote the power charged to the battery during interval $i$ as $s_i$, the power discharged from the battery as $d_i$, and the power consumed from the grid as $p_i$.   We combine both the battery array and inverter inefficiency into a single inefficiency parameter $e$.  Finally, we specify the cost per kWh over the $i$th interval as $c_i$, and the amount billed as $m_i$.   F

%Table~\ref{table:parameters} lists the parameters in our MILP, where the first seven parameters are properties of the home and the MILP determines the value of the last seven parameters.  In practice, solving this MILP requires predictions of a home's power demand, renewable generation, and possibly electricity prices (for RTP), since these values are not known in advance. For this work, we assume perfect future knowledge.  Thus, our results represent an upper bound on performance.

%home electric loads are substantially different than a data center's workload.

%Papers in the previous work look at things in isolation.  We combine them.  Inspired by Parasol, which does something similar for computing loads in a solar-powered data center.  Home loads are a little different; have different degrees of scheduling freedom, but may have more limitations.  We use a linear program below to do the scheduling.

%The first and second constraint ensure the energy charged to, or discharged from, the battery is non-negative. The third constraint limits the battery's maximum charging rate. The fourth constraint specifies that the power discharged from the battery is never greater than the power charged to the battery multiplied by the inefficiency parameter.  The fifth constraint states that the energy stored in the battery array, which is the difference between the energy charged to  or discharged from the battery over the previous time intervals, cannot be greater than its capacity. Finally, the sixth constraint defines the price the home pays for energy during the $i$th interval.  The objective and constraints define a linearly constrained optimization problem that is solvable using standard linear programming techniques.  SmartCharge solves the problem at the beginning of each day to determine when to switch between grid and battery power.  Since the approach uses knowledge of next-day consumption patterns, we next detail statistical machine learning techniques for predicting next-day consumption and quantify their accuracy for our case study home.
