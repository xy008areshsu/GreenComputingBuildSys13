Rising electricity prices over the past 20 years combined with a growing awareness of the environmental effects of burning fossil fuels, e.g., air pollution, climate disruption, water contamination, is motivating both energy producers and consumers to better optimize their electricity generation and consumption, respectively.   The simplest and most direct way to optimize the electric grid is for consumers to simply use less energy.  Unfortunately, despite continuing improvements in the energy-efficiency of electrical devices, society's energy demand continues to grow at a rapid pace---estimated to increase by 50\% over the next 20 years---driven in large part by population growth and improving economic conditions in developing countries. Since reducing overall energy consumption presents many non-technical challenges, one promising alternative approach to grid optimization has been to focus on reducing the grid's peak usage.  

The magnitude of the grid's peak usage has a disproportionate impact on electricity generation's capital and operational costs, as well as its carbon emissions.   For instance, a lower peak usage directly translates to less idle, unused generation capacity and a need for fewer expensive power plants.  In addition, the marginal cost to generate each additional watt of electricity increases non-linearly, since utilities usually dispatch the highest-cost ``peaking" generators last.   In fact, the cost to generate each watt using an oil-based peaking generator may be more than ten times the cost using a coal-fired baseload power plant.  Finally, since peaking generators tend to be the least efficient generators, they also produce more carbon emissions per watt. These trends have led utilities to introduce new variable rate electricity pricing plans that incentivize residential consumers to shift their power usage to the grid's peak usage. These pricing plans vary the price of electricity throughout the day, such that electricity costs more when grid demand is high, i.e., \emph{peak periods}, than when it is low, i.e., \emph{off-peak periods}.  Figure~\ref{fig:pricing} shows how electricity prices vary over a day with time-of-use (TOU) and real-time pricing (RTP).  With RTP plans, rates change every hour of every day based on the real-time price of electricity in the wholesale market, while with TOU plans, rates change only a few times each day and each day's rate profile remains constant over long periods, e.g., 3-6 months.

The goal of these new variable rate plans is to incentivize consumers to lower their electric bill by manually altering their behavior, i.e., when they perform certain energy-intensive tasks during the day.  For example, if electricity prices are much lower in the evening, consumers might choose to perform energy-intensive tasks, such as doing their laundry or running their dishwasher, in the evening, rather than the middle of the day.  In addition, variable rate pricing plans have also motivated researchers to develop a variety of advanced load scheduling algorithms for buildings and homes that programmatically control when electrical devices (or \emph{loads}) operate to lower a building's electricity bill.  

Instead of requiring consumers to manually alter their behavior, which many consumers may choose not to do regardless of electricity's price, these load scheduling algorithms exploit a limited degree of scheduling freedom available in a subset of loads.  This freedom includes the option to transparently \emph{shift}, \emph{slide}, \emph{stretch}, \emph{store}, or \emph{sell} some amount of power from some loads without involving end-consumers. For example, a load scheduling algorithm may partially i) \emph{shift} a thermostatic or timer-driven load's duty cycle, ii) \emph{slide} a batched load's start time into the future, iii) \emph{stretch} an elastic load's operation to reduce its peak usage, iv) \emph{store} power in a battery to alter a load's profile, or v) \emph{sell} power produced by renewables back to the grid or other buildings, e.g., in a microgrid.  Of course, each dimension of scheduling freedom has inherent scheduling limitations.  For example, an algorithm may only shift a refrigerator's duty cycle so far before its interior temperature becomes too high and food spoils.

Widespread adoption of these load scheduling algorithms would result in a significant reduction in the grid's peak usage, which in-turn would result in a significant decrease in the cost to generate electricity.  However, in this paper, we argue that today's variable rate pricing plans do not properly incentivize consumers to adopt these algorithms.  In particular, we show that optimizing each degree of scheduling freedom, either in isolation or collectively, within reasonable limits does not significantly reduce, e.g., by more than XX\%, a representative consumer's electric bill.  We also describe the potential adverse effects to the electric grid, including grid oscillations and higher peak load, if consumers were to adopt advanced load scheduling algorithms in large numbers under these pricing plans.  Unfortunately, since the original purpose of variable rate pricing plans was to alter consumer behavior with the implicit assumption that only a small fraction of consumers would respond to the pricing incentives, these plans neither encourage nor support advanced load scheduling, especially at large scales.

To address the problem, we propose a \emph{flat-power pricing} to directly incentivize consumers to flatten their own demand.  In particular, our pricing plan charges a higher price for electricity that is above a consumer-specific target set \emph{a priori} by the utility.  As a result, a flat-power pricing plan incentivizes shifting a load's power usage over shorter intervals than variable-rate pricing plans.  As a result, under flat-power pricing, consumers save more money on their electric bill by adopting advanced load scheduling algorithms.  In addition, as we discuss, since flat-power pricing encourages consumers (and load scheduling algorithms) to flatten their own demand, it avoids the adverse grid effects caused by the widespread adoption of load scheduling algorithms under today's variable rate plans.   Our hypothesis is that flat-power pricing better incentivizes advanced load scheduling algorithms, encouraging their adoption at large scales, than today's variable rate electricity pricing plans.  In evaluating our hypothesis, we make the following contributions.

\noindent {\bf Combined Load Scheduling.}  We develop a linear programming (LP) formulation that  combines all the degrees of scheduling freedom mentioned above to minimize electricity costs under variable rate pricing plans.  The LP formulation combines similar types of formulations from prior work that focus on optimizing each degree of scheduling freedom in isolation.  For a representative home, we show that combined load scheduling is only able to lower the electric bill by XX\% and XX\% under an existing time-of-use (TOU) and real-time pricing (RTP) plans, respectively.

\noindent {\bf Flat-power Pricing Model.}  We introduce flat-power pricing, and discuss its benefits relative to existing pricing models, including variable rate and peak-based pricing, with respect to incentivizing advanced load scheduling algorithms and encouraging consumers to change their behavior.  

%We also highlight the primary drawback of flat-power pricing---a perceived lack of fairness across homes---and discuss ways to address the problem.

\noindent {\bf Evaluation.}  We alter our combined LP formulation above to schedule loads to minimize electricity costs under our flat-power pricing plan.  For the same home as above, we show that with flat-power pricing, advanced load scheduling algorithms lower the electric bill by XX\%---significantly more than the savings from existing pricing plans.
