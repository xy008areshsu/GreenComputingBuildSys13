I - Installing Bonmin
The build process of Bonmin uses the standard GNU Autotools

It has been successfully compiled and run on the following platforms:
 - Linux using g++ version 4.5
 - Windows using version Cygwin 1.5.18
 - Mac OS X using gcc 4.5

Note that Bonmin reauires a certain number of third parties dependencies. Please visit:
https://projects.coin-or.org/Bonmin/wiki/ThirdParty
to find out how to obtain and install them.

Bonmin is then compiled and installed using the commands:

% ./configure
% make
% make install

This installs the executable bonmin in the bin subdirectory of the
installation direcory.

The configure script attempts to find all of the machine specific settings
(compiler, libraries,...) necessary to compile and run the code. Although
{\tt configure} should find most of the standard ones, you may have to
manually specify a few of the settings. The options for the configure
script can be found by issuing the command

% ./configure --help

For a more in depth description of these options, the reader is invited
to refer to the COIN-OR BuildTools trac page at:
https://projects.coin-or.org/BuildTools/

II - BUILDING THE DOCUMENTATION
The documentation for Bonmin consists of a users' manual and a reference
manual. You can build a local copy of the reference manual provided that
you have Latex
and Doxygen installed on your machine. To do it Issue the command

% make doxydoc
It calls Doxygen to build a copy of the reference manual. An html version
of the reference manual can then be accessed in doc/html/index.html.

III - RUNNING THE TEST PROGRAMS
By issuing the command
% make test
you build and run the automatic test program for Bonmin.
