<p class="Normal"><strong>OPTimization Interface (OPTI) Toolbox</strong></p>
<p class="Normal">For the latest OPTI announcements and details please see the 
Wiki Page:</p>

<hr />
<p class="Normal">OPTI Toolbox is a collection of m-files and 
compiled C-MEX functions for use in building and solving a range of optimization 
problems. Key functionality offered by this toolbox 
include:</p>
<p class="NormalIndent">- Easily construct optimization problems and solve them 
using a range of supplied or interfaced solvers<br />
- Automatically detects problem type, and uses the best solver available for the 
problem<br />
- Use powerful open source solvers such as IPOPT, SCIP, NOMAD and others<br />
- Perform solver benchmarking, plot optimization contours, and validate the 
solution<br />
- Read and write standard optimization files such as MPS and LP<br />
- Read and solve AMPL problems<br />
</p>
<p class="Normal">OPTI was originally developed to assist with my PhD work in 
energy system optimization, as I was commonly dealing with mixed-integer 
problems and MATLAB did not have any MIP solvers. However it has grown into a 
suite of solvers for just about any industry, and has seen use from motorsport 
to image reconstruction, space technology to financial modelling!</p>
