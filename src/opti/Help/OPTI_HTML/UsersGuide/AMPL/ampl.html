<p class="Normal"><span class="Heading2">Introduction</span></p>
<p class="Normal"><a href="http://www.ampl.com/" target="_blank">AMPL</a> (A 
Modeling Language for Mathematical Programming) is a modeling language that can 
be used to describe complex optimization problems ranging from linear to 
nonlinear including continuous and discrete variables. It is a widely used 
format, with over 59% of submissions to <a href="http://neos-server.org/neos/">
NEOS</a> in January 2011 being in AMPL format (<a href="http://www.gams.com/">GAMS</a> 
was second with 29.7%). Therefore while Matlab provides it&#39;s own powerful 
modeling language, it was important to be able to incorporate existing models 
from AMPL into OPTI.</p>
<p class="Heading2">Users with AMPL</p>
<p class="Normal">From OPTI Toolbox v1.76 users who have AMPL already installed 
on their PC (and on the MATLAB path) can use
<a class="Code" href="../../Functions/optiutil/amplRead.html">amplRead</a> 
directly on a .mod file, without having to following the conversion steps below. 
OPTI will automatically call the AMPL executable and perform the conversion, 
before reading the .nl, as below. See the documentation provided by
<span class="Code">amplRead()</span> above for more information.</p>
<p class="Heading2">Typical Use</p>
<p class="Normal">While most existing AMPL users will be familiar with the 
operation of AMPL, there will be some who need a quick overview. While AMPL is a 
modeling language, it is also an application front end to a range of solvers 
(much like OPTI). A notable feature however is the AMPL presolve which attempts 
to simplify the model prior to passing it to the solver. To use AMPL, one can 
obtain the free <a href="http://www.ampl.com/DOWNLOADS/index.html">student 
version</a>, however this is limited to 500 variables and 500 constraints. For 
larger problems you will need to purchase the
<a href="http://www.ampl.com/vendors.html">professional version</a>.</p>
<p class="Normal">A typical AMPL run consists of either running it from command 
window (i.e. DOS) or from the
<a href="http://www.ampl.com/DOWNLOADS/details.html#Scrolling">scrolling window 
utility</a> which is available for free. I prefer the command window version as 
I am more familiar with it this way. In order to run AMPL, complete the 
following steps (assuming you have downloaded AMPL and it is on your PC):</p>
<p class="Normal">1) Open the command window</p>
<p class="NormalIndent">Click on the start button and under All Programs -&gt; 
Accessories click on Command Prompt. Alternatively you can type &quot;cmd&quot; into the 
search bar at the bottom of the start menu.</p>
<p class="NormalIndent">
<img alt="cmd" height="624" src="Images/cmd.png" width="404" /></p>
<p class="Normal">2) Change the current directory to the AMPL directory</p>
<p class="NormalIndent">Unless the AMPL executable (ampl.exe) is on your 
system&#39;s path (you would have added it manually) you will need to change the 
current directory to the location of ampl.exe. Type &quot;cd x&quot; where x is the full 
path to the ampl executable.</p>
<p class="NormalIndent">
<img alt="cd" height="342" src="Images/cd.png" width="677" /></p>
<p class="Normal">3) Start AMPL</p>
<p class="NormalIndent">AMPL can be started by typing &quot;ampl&quot; into the command 
window. The AMPL parser will then accept commands directly from the command 
window:</p>
<p class="NormalIndent">
<img alt="ampl" height="342" src="Images/ampl.png" width="677" /></p>
<p class="Normal">4) Loading a Model and Data</p>
<p class="NormalIndent">AMPL is supplied with several example models in the 
MODELS folder. To load a model and data set, type the following:</p>
<p class="NormalIndent">
<img alt="model" height="342" src="Images/model.png" width="677" /></p>
<p class="Normal">5) Selecting the solver and solving the model</p>
<p class="NormalIndent">Selecting a solver is simple, and so is solving it:</p>
<p class="NormalIndent">
<img alt="solve" height="342" src="Images/solve.png" width="677" /></p>
<p class="NormalIndent">You can also display the decision variables using the 
display command, and the name of the variable (check the original .mod file):</p>
<p class="NormalIndent">
<img alt="display" height="342" src="Images/display.png" width="677" /></p>
<p class="NormalIndent">
There is a lot more to AMPL than the above brief overview but shows the general 
functionality. If you are interested in learning more about AMPL and it's 
language I suggest you get the <a href="http://www.ampl.com/BOOK/">AMPL book</a>.</p>
<p class="Heading2">Generating a .NL file for use with OPTI</p>
<p class="Normal">You would have noted the model loaded by AMPL in the above 
example was called diet.mod. If you open this file you will see this is a 
succinct definition of the problem written in AMPL, with the respective dataset 
contained in diet.dat. However this file is not used directly by any solver, and 
is in fact parsed to a .NL file internally by AMPL before being passed to a solver. This 
allows AMPL to perform the presolve + reordering and other algorithm tricks in 
order to best solve the problem. While this process happens behind the scenes, 
we can tell AMPL to generate us a .NL file which can be read by OPTI using the 
following command:</p>
<p class="NormalIndent">ampl -og(1) (2) (3) (4)</p>
<p class="Normal">Where (1) is the output file name, (2) is the model .mod file, 
(3) is the optional data .dat file, and (4) is the optional options file. Note 
AMPL is <strong>not</strong> open at this point, and is called as part of the 
command!</p>
<p class="Normal"><img alt="nl" height="354" src="Images/nl.png" width="677" /></p>
<p class="Normal">If you have a look at the generated diet.nl file it is quite unintelligible 
to us, however it makes for easy parsing by the
<a href="http://www.netlib.org/ampl/solvers/">AMPL Solver Library</a>, which is 
free code from Netlib written by the creators of AMPL to allow users to connect 
their own solvers to the AMPL engine. This library has been implemented as a MEX 
function in <a href="../../Functions/optiutil/amplRead.html" class="Code">amplRead</a> in 
OPTI allowing us to read in the .NL file and solve just about any AMPL problem! 
Simply generate a .NL file for any AMPL model you wish to solve using the above 
step, and open it using <span class="Code">amplRead</span><span class="Normal"> 
to create an </span><span class="Code">
